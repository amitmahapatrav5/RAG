# I have uploaded a sample BRD Document in this space. In this chat, I have uploaded a architecture diagram. By looking at the architecture diagram(.png format) and the reference of BRD Document which I uploaded, please create the BRD Document for the provided Architecture Diagram

Here’s a complete BRD tailored to the provided architecture diagram, aligned to the structure and tone of the sample BRD that was shared in this space. The BRD maps business goals, requirements, and non-functional needs to the depicted three-API + API Gateway + chat UI architecture.

Business Requirements Document (BRD) — Multi-API GenAI Knowledge and Content System

Direct answer: This BRD specifies the business context, scope, detailed functional and non-functional requirements, interfaces, data, security, risks, MVP plan, and success criteria for the chat-based solution shown in the diagram, aligning its sections and phrasing to the provided sample BRD while adapting to the depicted SQL API, Content API, and GenAI API behind an API Gateway with a conversational UI frontend. The roles, guardrails, validation, and phased MVP approach mirror the prior BRD’s style and depth, adapted for vector search, content retrieval, and SQL/file operations present in the architecture.[^1]

Overview

- Summary: Build a chat-first application that allows users to query, store, retrieve, and manage knowledge through three backend services—SQL API, Content API, and GenAI API—exposed via an API Gateway and surfaced in a conversational UI with instruction input and thread history management. The system will support ingestion of files to SQL, object storage content retrieval, vectorization for retrieval-augmented generation, and natural-language querying with guardrails.[^1]
- Business problem: Current form/document navigation and fragmented backends slow access to knowledge; users lack a unified chat interface to store, retrieve, and synthesize content across structured SQL, unstructured files, and vectorized knowledge.[^1]

Business value

- Efficiency: Reduce time to locate and synthesize answers by centralizing retrieval across SQL rows, content files, and vector indexes in one chat workflow through the API Gateway.[^1]
- Cost and accuracy: Improve answer accuracy via guardrailed RAG, reduce rework from incomplete inputs, and standardize access patterns across systems using REST APIs modeled after the sample BRD approach to validation and API-first integration.[^1]

Scope

- In scope: Chat UI, thread history, instruction prompt, API Gateway routing, SQL API (/files CRUD), Content API (/file CRUD), GenAI API (/vectorize, /query), embeddings storage in vector DB, guardrails, and auditing/logging similar to the sample’s audibility standards.[^1]
- Out of scope: Direct user access to underlying stores, non-chat batch pipelines, custom analytics dashboards beyond conversation logs and standard metrics in MVP.[^1]

Users and stakeholders

- Primary users: Knowledge workers uploading/searching files, analysts querying structured SQL records, and teams leveraging GenAI summaries with citations through the chat.[^1]
- Secondary stakeholders: Platform/IT operations for API Gateway and service maintenance; compliance/SecOps for policy enforcement and audit; data owners for schema and content governance as patterned in the sample BRD.[^1]

Functional requirements

- Chat interface
    - Provide instruction field, free-form query box, and per-user thread history list with load/continue actions, matching the diagram layout and the conversational capture style emphasized in the sample BRD.[^1]
    - Show response messages with sources/IDs when available; allow user confirmation for actions that modify data (e.g., delete file) as in the sample’s “preview and confirmation” pattern.[^1]
- API Gateway mediation
    - Route requests to the SQL API, Content API, and GenAI API; enforce auth, rate limits, request/response normalization, and consistent error codes.[^1]
- SQL API
    - POST /files: Ingest structured file metadata or parsed records; validate schema; return file/record IDs and status.[^1]
    - GET /files: Search/list with filters (name, tags, date, owner); support pagination and sorting.[^1]
    - DELETE /file: Delete by ID with soft-delete option and confirmation flow in UI.[^1]
- Content API
    - GET /file: Retrieve object/binary or signed URL; track access logs.[^1]
    - POST /file: Upload files; store metadata (title, type, tags, owner); optionally trigger vectorization pipeline.[^1]
    - DELETE /file: Remove object and metadata with retention policy enforcement and UI confirmation.[^1]
- GenAI API
    - POST /vectorize: Generate embeddings for ingested content (SQL rows or files), writing vectors to the vector DB and returning vector IDs for linkage to originals.[^1]
    - GET /query: Accept user query, retrieve top-k vectors, construct RAG prompt, apply guardrails, and return answer with ranked source references and confidence signals, aligned to the sample’s “summary generation and validation” flow.[^1]
- Guardrails and validation
    - Validate input completeness (e.g., required fields for upload); detect PII policy violations; apply toxicity/hate bias filters; constrain model to retrieved context for grounded responses per the sample’s guardrails approach.[^1]
- Conversation memory
    - Persist turns, selected instruction, referenced sources, and derived summaries per thread; enable resume and auditing similar to the sample’s auditability requirement.[^1]
- Admin/operations
    - View service health, ingestion jobs, vectorization status, and API error rates; administer retention windows and access controls following the sample’s maintainability and governance practices.[^1]

Non-functional requirements

- Performance: Sub-2s typical chat round-trip excluding long-running file uploads; 90% of API calls within SLA; asynchronous vectorization with status callbacks, echoing the sample’s latency and async patterns.[^1]
- Scalability: Horizontal scale of API Gateway and stateless services; sharded vector DB and object storage to support growth and concurrent users.[^1]
- Security: SSO, least-privilege access to services, encryption in transit/at rest, content policy enforcement, and no data use outside approved network boundaries as emphasized in the sample BRD.[^1]
- Usability: Low-friction chat UX with progressive disclosure; context-aware prompts; preview before destructive actions, matching the sample’s UX guidance.[^1]
- Auditability: Retain logs of prompts, retrieved chunks, sources, and API calls with timestamps and IDs, consistent with the sample’s audit logging mandate.[^1]
- Maintainability: Config-driven connectors, schema versioning, and modular APIs; minimal code changes for adding new content types or tables, similar to the sample’s scalability/maintainability stance.[^1]

Data model and flows

- Entities
    - File: id, name, type, size, owner, tags, checksum, storage_uri, created_at, vectorized_at.[^1]
    - Vector: id, file_id or record_id, embedding_ref, chunk_range, created_at.[^1]
    - Thread: id, user_id, instruction, created_at, last_active_at.[^1]
    - Message: id, thread_id, role, content, sources, latency_ms, created_at.[^1]
- Ingestion flow
    - UI upload → API Gateway → Content API POST /file → optional SQL metadata write → GenAI API POST /vectorize → vector DB entries linked to original file/record, following the sample’s ingestion and validation pattern.[^1]
- Query flow
    - UI query → API Gateway → GenAI API GET /query → top-k retrieve → guardrails → answer with citations → UI displays with source chips, consistent with sample’s summary/validation/confirmation cycle.[^1]

Interfaces and contracts

- SQL API: JSON over HTTPS, OAuth2/SSO; returns IDs, pagination cursors, and standard error schema; supports filterable GET /files and transactional delete semantics.[^1]
- Content API: Multipart uploads and streaming downloads; signed URL issuance where applicable; virus scanning hooks; metadata JSON sidecar.[^1]
- GenAI API: Vectorize accepts text/chunked payload refs; Query accepts text plus optional thread_id and filters; returns answer, sources, scores, and moderation flags, per the sample’s structured prompts and validation outputs.[^1]

Security and privacy

- Authentication: Enterprise SSO; service-to-service tokens via API Gateway; audit all access as in the sample BRD.[^1]
- Authorization: Role-based controls for upload, delete, admin; row/file-level access filters applied in SQL and vector retrieval layers.[^1]
- Data handling: Encrypt at rest/in transit; configurable retention; redaction of sensitive data in logs; content policy checks before vectorization as mirrored from the sample’s compliance stance.[^1]

Assumptions

- Underlying vector DB and object store are enterprise-approved; embeddings cost and throughput are within budget/SLA; existing schemas for SQL /files are stable enough for MVP.[^1]
- Chat UX patterns and governance policies from the sample BRD extend to this multi-API solution without additional approvals for MVP.[^1]

Constraints

- Dependency on model and embeddings throughput; cross-API latency bounded by Gateway and network; storage and egress costs for large files must fit budget.[^1]
- Naming and retention policies may restrict delete patterns; some content may require hold/legal review processes before deletion.[^1]

Risks and mitigations

- Data drift or stale vectors: Re-index schedule and change-data-capture triggers for SQL/content updates.[^1]
- Hallucinations: Strict RAG construction, source-attribution UI, and refusal when confidence is low per sample guardrail strategy.[^1]
- Adoption: Provide side-by-side access and training, aligning to the sample’s phased rollout guidance.[^1]

MVP plan

- MVP1
    - Chat UI with instruction and history; Content API upload/download; GenAI API vectorize/query; basic SQL /files list; source attributions; guardrails for toxicity and PII; audit logs for conversations and API calls, mirroring the sample’s MVP1 framing.[^1]
    - Success: Users can upload a file, vectorize it, and get grounded answers with citations in under ~2s median latency for short queries (excluding upload time).[^1]
- MVP2
    - Fine-tuned prompts for better summarization; server-side re-ranking; SQL record-level ingestion and vectorization; advanced admin console; golden-record style validation for specific domains adapted from the sample’s MVP2 enhancements.[^1]

Success criteria

- Adoption: Sustained weekly active threads per user cohort comparable to target usage in the sample; retention of conversations over 4 weeks.[^1]
- Cost reduction: Reduced time spent searching and synthesizing, reflected in baseline vs. post-deployment time-on-task; lower duplicate content requests by leveraging shared vectors.[^1]
- Data accuracy: <5% corrective follow-ups due to hallucination or missing context; majority answers contain at least one valid citation.[^1]
- System performance: ≥90% of chat queries within SLA; successful vectorization for ≥95% of supported files; low error rates across APIs, echoing the sample’s SLA posture.[^1]

Governance and compliance

- Apply AI guardrails for hallucination, bias, toxicity; enforce enterprise data handling and locality requirements; maintain audit trails for reviews as required in the sample BRD.[^1]

Acceptance criteria

- A user can upload a document via UI, observe successful Content API ingestion, and see vectorization status complete with traceable IDs in logs.[^1]
- A user can ask a question and receive an answer with at least two source citations, with the ability to preview and navigate to the referenced file or SQL record if authorized.[^1]
- An admin can delete a file, confirm in UI, and verify soft-delete markers and retention behavior across Content API, SQL metadata, and vector DB tombstones.[^1]

Operational metrics

- Query latency, vectorization throughput, ingestion failures, citation coverage, guardrail trigger rates, and per-API error distributions reported to platform dashboards similar to the sample’s auditability/observability goals.[^1]

Training and rollout

- Short how-to guides embedded in the chat UI, live office hours during week 1–4, and opt-in coexistence with legacy knowledge portals in early phases, in line with the sample’s adoption guidance.[^1]
